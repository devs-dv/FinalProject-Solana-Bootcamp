## Introduction

Welcome to the README for the Rise In Solana Bootcamp NFT Contract final project. This document provides an in-depth overview of the project, its functionalities, and detailed instructions on deploying, testing, and interacting with the contract.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a unique NFT (Non-Fungible Token) contract on the Solana blockchain. This NFT contract is the result of the final project in the Rise In Solana Bootcamp, focusing on token transfer and management. 

## Functionalities

The NFT contract developed during the final project offers the following core functionalities:

- **Minting NFTs**: Create new NFTs with customizable properties and metadata.
- **Burning NFTs**: Permanently remove NFTs from circulation.
- **Transferring NFTs**: Transfer ownership of NFTs between users.
- **TypeScript Tests**: Comprehensive TypeScript testing for all implemented functionalities.

### Additional Functionalities (Optional)

Feel free to extend the contract with additional functionalities or customizations as per your project requirements.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before deploying and interacting with the NFT contract, you'll need the following:

- A Solana-compatible wallet.
- Access to the Solana blockchain network (Testnet or Mainnet).
- The contract code and any necessary dependencies, which you should have obtained during the bootcamp.

### Installation

1. Clone or download the contract code and its dependencies.
2. Install any required development tools or libraries for Solana contract development.

## Deployment

The deployment process for your NFT contract on the Solana blockchain involves the following steps:

1. Deploy the contract to the Solana blockchain using the Codigo platform.
2. Verify the contract deployment on the Solana blockchain. Ensure that the contract address is accessible and accurate.

For detailed deployment instructions, refer to the bootcamp materials provided by Rise In.

## Interacting with the Contract

After deploying the contract, you can interact with it using various methods and tools, including:

- **Minting NFTs**: Create new NFTs with custom metadata.
- **Transferring NFTs**: Transfer ownership of NFTs to other Solana wallet addresses.
- **Burning NFTs**: Permanently destroy NFTs to remove them from circulation.

Detailed usage instructions, including code examples, command-line interactions, and possible error scenarios, should be documented within your project materials.

## Testing

Comprehensive TypeScript tests have been implemented to ensure the contract's functionalities work as expected. These tests cover minting, burning, and transferring NFTs.
